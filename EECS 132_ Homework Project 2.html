<h2>Programming Project 2</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, March 6 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to give you practice writing loops.  </p>

<p>This second programming assignment is to give you practice writing and manipulating strings.  Arrays are not needed, <em>and you should not
use arrays in your assignment</em>.  All the methods you create should be <tt>static</tt>.</p>

<p>While it may be tempting to hunt through the API to find classes and methods that can shorten your code, you may not
do that.  In most cases, the API methods may shorten the <em>writing</em> of your code but increase its <em>running time</em>.
The only classes and methods you can use are listed below.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: you must not use either <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt> in your code.  These two commands almost always are used to compensate for
a poorly designed loop.</p>

<p>You <em>are allowed</em> to use the following from the Java API:
</p><ul><li>class String
    <ul><li>length</li>
        <li>charAt</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class StringBuilder
   <ul><li>length</li>
       <li>charAt</li>
       <li>append</li>
       <li>toString</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class Character
    <ul><li>any method</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>NumberFormatException</li>
    <ul>only the class, no method of the class
   </ul>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>All methods listed below must be <tt>public</tt> and <tt>static</tt>.</li>
<li>No additional methods are needed.  
However, you may write additional <em>private</em> helper methods, but you need to have efficient and simple algorithms. Do not write helper methods that do extra, unnecessary,
traversals of the data.</li>
<li>You should place a comment at the top of the file that contains your name
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be only describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Do not simply copy the descriptions
below for your comments.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment directly above each field (should you really have any?)
indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.  Ideally, you should list the goal of the 
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good iteration subgoal for the loop.</li>
<li>Any other complicated code such as code the has lots of if statements or variables should contain <em>short</em> comments to help the reader.  The comments can either be above the code fragment or to the right, aligned in a column.</li>
<li>If your code is using a loop to modify or create a string, you need to use the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> class from the API.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You should not use the commands <tt>break</tt> nor <tt>continue</tt> in your loops.</li>
<li>Remember to use good style: everything should be indented nicely, 
variables should have good names, there should be a blank line between 
each method.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>HW 2</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java file and your testing report.
Remember to attach the files that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>Part I: Programming (60% of your grade will be correctness of the following)</h3>

<p>Try to keep your code as simple as possible.</p>


<p>Create a class called <tt>HW2</tt> that contains the following methods:
</p><ol>

<li><p><tt>everykToTheNthChar</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>.  Let us call the 
second input <em>k</em> (but you can name it something else).  The method returns a <tt>String</tt> that contains the 1st character of the input,
the <em>k</em>th characther of the input, the <em>k^2</em>th character of the input, the <em>k^3</em>th character of the input, etc.
Return the input string if <em>k</em> is smaller than 2.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.everykToTheNthChar("1234567890", 2)
"1248"
&gt; HW2.everykToTheNthChar("1234567890", 3)
"139"
&gt; HW2.everykToTheNthChar("Case Western", 3)
"Cst"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>containsSubSequence</tt> takes two <tt>String</tt>s  as input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>:
Returns <tt>true</tt> if the first input string contains all the characters of the second input string, in order, but not necessarily consecutively.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.containsSubSequence("abracadabra", "abcd")
true
&gt; HW2.containsSubSequence("abracadabra", "abdc")
false
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>subtract</tt> takes two <tt>String</tt>s and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
The output string should be the same as the first input string except 
that you should remove the characters of the second string as follows:
remove the first occurrence of the first character, the first occurrence
 of the second character that appears <em>after</em> the removed 
character,
the first occurrence of the third character that appears after the first
 two removed characters, etc.  If there is no such character to remove, 
then
nothing further is removed.
</p><pre>HW2.subtract("gfedcbabcdefg", "acfa")
"gfedcbbdeg"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>doubleValue</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>double</tt>:<br>
The input should contain only digits, up to one period <tt>'.'</tt> and may contain one dash, but only as the first character <tt>'-'</tt>.
The method should return the <tt>double</tt> value that input string 
represents.  The input may have any number of leading or trailing zeros.
If the number is not in the correct format (more than one period, the 
dash is not the first character, or any other non-digit character), then
report an error by using the statement <tt>throw new NumberFormatException()</tt>.
Note that there may be <em>very small</em> unavoidable errors due to converting the decimal notation of the string to the binary of the double.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.doubleValue("0034.143003")
34.143003
&gt; HW2.doubleValue("0034.143.003")
java.lang.NumberFormatException
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>everyNthCharOfWord</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
If we call the input <tt>int</tt> value <em>n</em>, the output should contain the <em>n</em>th character of each <em>word</em> of the input string, in order.
If the word does not have <em>n</em> characters, a space should be used for the character.  A word is defined as a consecutive sequence of English letters.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.everyNthCharOfWord("Hello everyone!  This is terrific fun!", 2)
"evhseu"
&gt; HW2.everyNthCharOfWord("Hello everyone!  This is terrific fun!", 4)
"lrs r "
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>flipWords</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
Each word of the input string is reversed in the output string, though the order of the words stays the same.
A word is defined as a consecutive sequence of English letters.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.flipWords("Seventy-six trombones in the big parade!!")
"ytneveS-xis senobmort ni eht gib edarap!!"
</pre>
<p></p></li>


<li><p><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> <tt>transpose</tt>:  Takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
The output string is ordered so that, if it is printed, the first word 
of the input is printed vertically in the first column.  The second word
 appears
vertical in the second column, and so forth.  The total number of rows 
of text should equal the length of the longest word.  Here, a word is 
either a 
sequence of consecutive English letters or a sequence of non-whitespace,
 non-letters.
(You should look up the special characters such as the <em>newline</em> character in your textbook.)
</p><pre>&gt; String s = HW2.transpose("Hello everyone!!!   This is $100,000 worth of fun!")
&gt; System.out.println(s)
He!Ti$wof!
ev!hs1ofu
le!i 0r n
lr s 0t 
oy   ,h 
 o   0  
 n   0  
 e   0  
&gt;
</pre>
<p></p></li>

</ol><p></p>

<h3>Part 2: Project Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You need to write tests for each of the methods above.  Your tests 
should be thorough.
Your testing report should describe why your test cases sufficiently 
tested your code as well as the specific tests you ran and their 
results.
If you are unable to complete a method above, you should still
describe tests that would test the method had it been completed.</p>

<p>Hints for testing loops.  Your tests need to, at the minimum cover the following cases:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Test 0, test 1, test many:</strong>  This means you have to test cases where the parameters, if they are integers,
are 0, 1 or some value other than 1.  If the parameters are strings, you have to test strings of length 0, 1, and more than 1.
If the strings must contain certain data, you need to test cases where they contain 0, 1, and more than 1 of the desired data.</li>
<li><strong>Test first, last, and middle:</strong>  In cases where you 
have to search in or modify a string, you need to test
cases where the item to be found or modified is the first character of 
the string, the last character of the string, or somewhere
in the middle of the string.</li>
</ol><p></p>

<p>In summary, your tests should cover each of the above cases for each of the methods you complete in the homework.
Your testing report should state what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> mean for each of the homework
methods and how your tests covered these cases.</p>

<p><strong>JUnit</strong>: you will be learning about JUnit soon in a lab.  JUnit will be required for future homeworks, and you are welcome
to use it with this homework.  If you choose to write JUnit tests for your code,
your report should not list the specific tests and their results because the graders can run your JUnit tests.
Instead, your report should only detail what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> means for each
method and why your JUnit tests cover those cases.
